# Task requirements
## Assignment
## Objectives
The main objective of this task is to help you get familiar with the business context of system integration and to provide practical experience in modelling and automation of business processes by implementation of standard notation and integration patterns.
## Tasks
The task is to design a business process and develop a software application workflow, which integrates and automates several disparate operations.
You can choose between processes related to either a) organization of customer activation, or
b) handling of customer complains
Requirements
The business process involves business rules, software services, and human tasks.
The model is defined in standard business process modelling notation (BPMN) and delivered in graphical
representation.
The solution implements enterprise integration patterns (EIP) and good programming practices.
It is supplemented by a readme.md file, where the authors’ identification and the business scenario are introduced.
There is no requirement for using specific programming language for the application, but an automation platform, such as Camunda, Apache Camel, or an alternative must be implemented.
Presentation
A Github link to the project solution must be uploaded to Peergrade. Reviewing of other solutions will be required.
The successful completion of this assignment brings 20 credits (15 for a proper solution plus 5 for a proper feedback or self-evaluation).
